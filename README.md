`Swim Search.ipynb`

Description: Main Jupyter notebook for integrating the total set of tasks
in using ML-DO to search for efficient swimming in biohybrid fin geometries.
This include generating a master list to store simulations results for each
sDNA configurations. Then generating the initial search of which shapes to 
examine. Finally calls the main search algorithm, which creates a kinematic
mesh of each fin shape, generates the vertex normal, solves their velocities
for each frame, and then inserts this into the LBM fluid dynamics simulation.
LBM model than simulates the relative travel speed of each swimmer, which is
used as training data for the neural network model. Model then makes iterative
suggestions on which swimmers to simulate next.
